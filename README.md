Based on the information from the GitHub repository, here's a draft for a README file for the Chess game project:

# Chess Game with MinMax Algorithm

## Overview

This project is a chess game implemented in Python 3.7, featuring two gameplay modes: Player vs. AI and Player vs. Player. The AI opponent utilizes the MinMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine its moves, providing a challenging experience for players. The search depth for the AI is set to 2, balancing complexity and performance.

## Features

- Two gameplay modes: Player vs. AI and Player vs. Player.
- AI uses the MinMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
- Graphical user interface using tkinter for an engaging game experience.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- tkinter library for the GUI

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Install dependencies if necessary (e.g., tkinter, which is included with Python).

## Running the Game

To start the game, run the `main.py` file from your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python main.py
```
